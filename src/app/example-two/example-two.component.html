    <div>
        For our second example, we are going to do something ambitious. We are going to map a plot with several Python libraries with the help of Pyodide!
        <br>
        First, we have to import the libraries that we are going to use (such as numpy and matplotlib).
        In order to do that, we have to declare the imports in Python:
    </div>

    <pre><code [highlight]="code"></code></pre>

    <div>
        and then execute the code:
    </div>

    <pre><code [highlight]="code2"></code></pre>

    <div>
        As you can see, we are wrapping the imports in a different Pyodide wrapper.
        This time, in order for the imports to work properly we have to run the Python code inside an asynchronous function.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        Once we imported our libraries, we have to write our Python code, like in the previous example: 
    </div>

    <pre><code [highlight]="code3"></code></pre>
    
    <div>
        This code generates the plot, its value fields and the 'plot' button, as well as append all of these components into our html page.
    </div>

    <div>
        Finally, we just have to run the code:
    </div>

    <pre><code [highlight]="code4"></code></pre>

    <div>
        and voil√†!
    </div>

    <br><br>
